# ðŸ§® Numerical Playground

An interactive educational tool for exploring numerical methods and algorithms.

## Overview

Numerical Playground is a web-based application that allows users to:

- Visualize numerical algorithms in action
- Explore different methods for solving mathematical problems
- Compare convergence rates and behavior of various approaches
- Learn through interactive experimentation

## Features

- **Root Finding Methods**: Bisection, Newton's Method, Fixed Point Iteration
- **Systems of Equations**: Gaussian Elimination, Jacobi Method (coming soon)
- **Interpolation**: Lagrange, Newton's Divided Differences (coming soon)
- **Optimization**: Gradient Descent, Golden Section Search (coming soon)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
